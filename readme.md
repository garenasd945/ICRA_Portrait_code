# Our Participates Experiment

We recruited four subjects and used iPhone7 Plus to take their headshots. The model was trained with 7 styles of sketch images for testing. Click on the following links to view the corresponding test results.

In the actual test, the photos were taken with an iPhone 7 Plus. After the CycleGAN model stylized the photos, the best results were achieved with Styles 5, 6, and 7, followed by Styles 1 and 2, and the worst were Styles 3 and 4. The results of Style 5 are shown in the figure below:

We also used a drawing machine to draw on the stylized photos, and the final result is shown below
